Simple Python-based Static Code Analyzer for C programs based on GLib/GStreamer.
The tool takes advantage of the GObject-Introspection annotations built on top
of GTK-Doc comment blocks. Note that this tool is proof-of-concept only.

To be able to run it, you should install pylangparser first:
    https://github.com/otonchev/pylangparser/wiki

To run it, just type:
    python c_code_analyzer.py
